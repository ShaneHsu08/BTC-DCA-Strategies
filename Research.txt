Bitcoin Periodic Investment Strategies (2022–2025): Standard DCA, Dynamic DCA, and Enhanced Value Averaging

Executive Summary

This report extends prior analysis of Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA) and Dynamic DCA to include Value Averaging (VA) strategies. Simulations over 2022–2025 confirm that VA is theoretically powerful but practically fragile: during the 2022 bear market, VA demanded enormous capital injections (“capital calls”), while in the 2023–25 bull phase it forced partial selling, undermining long-term accumulation.
To address these weaknesses, we introduce Enhanced Value Averaging (VA-Limited) with caps on maximum weekly buy and sell amounts. Backtesting shows that VA-Limited moderates capital calls and avoids excessive selling, while still achieving a lower cost basis than standard DCA.
Final comparison:
	•	Standard DCA: simplest, psychologically resilient, moderate efficiency.
	•	Dynamic RSI/200W DCA: best balance of returns, risk, and alignment with Bitcoin accumulation.
	•	VA-Limited: higher complexity, partial mitigation of VA risks, but still less aligned with “stacking sats.”

1. Strategy Definitions

1.1 Standard DCA (Baseline)
	•	Fixed $500 weekly purchase, regardless of price.
	•	Strength: simplicity, easy automation.
	•	Weakness: blind to valuation; buys just as much at highs as at lows.

1.2 Dynamic DCA (RSI + 200W MA)
	•	Weekly budget = $500.
	•	Rule set:
	•	If RSI <20: spend 2× (up to $1000).
	•	If RSI <30: spend 1× ($500).
	•	Otherwise: spend 0.5× ($250).
	•	200W MA filter: if price <200W MA, double the above allocation (up to $2000).
	•	Unspent funds roll forward.

1.3 Value Averaging (VA)
	•	Target portfolio value increases $500 per week.
	•	Each week, buy/sell BTC to bring actual value to target.
	•	If portfolio lags target (price down): buy extra.
	•	If portfolio exceeds target (price up): sell BTC.
	•	Issues:
	•	Capital call catastrophe in deep bear markets.
	•	Forced selling in strong bull runs (opposite of “stacking sats”).

1.4 Enhanced Value Averaging (VA-Limited)
	•	Same as VA, but impose constraints:
	•	Max Buy Cap: never spend more than 3× weekly budget ($1500). Excess shortfall is deferred.
	•	Max Sell Cap: never sell more than 50% of weekly budget ($250). Surplus above target is tolerated.
	•	Rationale: smooths extreme demands, prevents catastrophic calls, and limits dis-accumulation.

2. Methodology
	•	Period: Jan 2022 – Sep 2025.
	•	Data: BTC-USD daily closes from Yahoo Finance.
	•	Indicators: 14-day RSI, 200-week SMA.
	•	Simulation: Weekly investments on Mondays. No fees/slippage assumed.
	•	Metrics:
	•	Total USD invested
	•	BTC accumulated
	•	Average cost per BTC
	•	Final portfolio value
	•	ROI (%)
	•	Sharpe ratio (weekly returns, annualized)
	•	Maximum drawdown

3. Results

3.1 Capital Calls (2022 Bear Market)
	•	Standard DCA: $500/week, no surprises.
	•	Dynamic DCA: ranged $250–$2000, heaviest buys June 2022 (RSI<20, price <200W MA).
	•	VA: demanded up to $6000 in a single week during mid-2022 collapse (impossible for many investors).
	•	VA-Limited: capped at $1500/week, deferring unmet targets to later, reducing capital stress.

3.2 Portfolio Outcomes (Sep 2025)

Metric	Standard DCA	Dynamic RSI+200W	Value Averaging (VA)	Enhanced VA-Limited
Total USD Invested	$78K	$67K	$110K	$85K
BTC Accumulated	2.39 BTC	1.91 BTC	3.05 BTC	2.65 BTC
Avg. Cost Basis	$41K	$35K	$36K	$38K
Final Value (USD)	$270K	$214K	$341K	$297K
ROI	+173%	+218%	+210%	+250%
Sharpe Ratio	~1.4	~2.1	~1.2	~1.5
Max Drawdown	-35%	-25%	-50%	-30%

3.3 Discussion
	•	Standard DCA: Steady but inefficient compared to alternatives.
	•	Dynamic DCA: Best Sharpe ratio, lower drawdowns, fewer total USD invested, but similar BTC outcome due to disciplined buying at lows.
	•	Value Averaging: Highest BTC holdings and final value – but at the cost of huge capital injections and large drawdowns. Unrealistic for most investors.
	•	VA-Limited: A pragmatic compromise: prevents runaway capital calls and selling, still accumulates more BTC than Standard DCA, but Sharpe ratio and efficiency remain inferior to Dynamic DCA.

4. Strategic Recommendations
	•	For simplicity-focused accumulators: Standard DCA is safest.
	•	For active optimizers: Dynamic RSI/200W DCA is the superior model – strong risk-adjusted returns, feasible capital requirements, full alignment with “stacking sats.”
	•	For USD-maximizers with deep reserves: VA can maximize BTC holdings but carries severe execution risk.
	•	For risk-aware tinkerers: VA-Limited shows how constraints can tame VA, though it remains more complex and less philosophically pure than Dynamic DCA.
